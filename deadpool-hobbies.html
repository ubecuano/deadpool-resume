    <h1>My Hobbies:</h1>
    <ol>
        <h2><li><strong>Collecting Swords</strong></li></h2>
            <p>I have a serious passion for collecting all sorts of swordsâ€”from katanas to cutlasses. My love for these sharp toys goes beyond just using them in battle; I enjoy admiring their craftsmanship, testing their sharpness, and occasionally naming them after my favorite TV characters.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>"Every time I get a new sword, I like to see how many watermelons I can slice in one go. The current record is 37, but Iâ€™m aiming for 50. Watermelons beware!"</em></li>
                    <li><em>"Naming my swords is like naming my childrenâ€”except these children are sharp, deadly, and donâ€™t cry when you accidentally drop them."</em></li>
                </ul>
        <h2><li><strong>Watching Cartoons</strong></li></h2>
            <p>I may be an unstoppable mercenary, but I love unwinding with some good old-fashioned cartoons. Whether itâ€™s the Saturday morning classics or the latest animated superhero flicks, Iâ€™ve always got a bowl of cereal in hand and a sarcastic commentary running in my head.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>"Thereâ€™s nothing quite like watching a coyote blow himself up 50 times while munching on a bowl of cereal. Itâ€™s called stress relief, people!"</em></li>
                    <li><em>"If I ever meet the guy who made 'SpongeBob,' Iâ€™m giving him a swordâ€”one of my favorites. Because anyone who can create that much chaos deserves a sharp gift."</em></li>
                </ul>
        <h2><li><strong>Pranking the X-Men</strong></li></h2>
            <p>I have an unholy love for pranking the X-Men, particularly Wolverine. From setting up elaborate traps to simple jump scares, no one is safe from my mischievous antics. Itâ€™s my way of showing affectionâ€”well, that and driving them all insane.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>"Nothing says â€˜good morningâ€™ like Wolverine waking up to find his claws glued to the bed frame. Just call me the Picasso of pranks!"</em></li>
                    <li><em>"One time I replaced all of Cyclopsâ€™ visors with 3D glasses. He wasnâ€™t amused, but I gotta say, his laser blasts looked epic in 3D!"</em></li>
                </ul>
    </ol>
